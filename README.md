# Easy-Nav

# Introduction 
As the campus of the college continuous to expand, navigating its indoor spaces has become increasingly challenging
Unlike outdoor environments where GPS navigation systems are popular, indoor areas lack such universally accessible guidance systems. 
This problem is especially experienced by newcomers unfamiliar with the layout, as well as during events or emergencies where rapid and accurate navigation is crucial.
# Problem statement
Navigating through the intricate indoor spaces of a campus presents a challenge for students, faculty, and visitors alike. 
Unlike outdoor environments where GPS navigation systems are popular, indoor areas lack such universally accessible guidance systems. 
The absence of efficient indoor navigation solutions often leads to confusion and a sense of disorientation among individuals trying to locate specific rooms, offices, or facilities within the campus premises. 
This problem is especially experienced by newcomers unfamiliar with the layout, as well as during events or emergencies where rapid and accurate navigation is crucial.
# Goal of the project
Our project aims to solve the problem of navigating in indoor space of our college to solve this problem we have come up with an amazing solution called Easy-Nav. With Easy-Nav the newcomers in our college and the parents who are not familiarized with the college campus can navigate through the floors and find where they need to go, without waiting or asking someone and getting confused in turn.
Our project methodology involves making a simple GUI design for the user where the user can see the information, and the names of the rooms that exist on that floor, Easy input for the user by just clicking the layout of the map and finding the shortest path towards their destination. Our main goal was to ease he visiting experience of the User and help the person reach their destination without wasting their valuable time
Since this project Is in developing stages it has been made in three parts :
1.The pathfinding part of the program (currently only implemented for the 1st floor)
2.The render of the map as the user passes for the future implementation of live tracking
3.The 3d model of the first floor
# Future Scope
1.Development of an Mobile App
2.Implementation of the map and navigation in 3D for increasing the interaction from the user side
